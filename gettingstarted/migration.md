title: Migrating from Drafts 4
---

{% include back.html title="Getting Started" path="/gettingstarted" %}

If you are a user of previous versions of Drafts, Drafts 5 installs a separate app and will not affect your installation of Drafts 4. Both operate completely independently, but drafts and actions can be migrated from Drafts 4 to Drafts 5 at any time.  It is up to your to decided when and if you wish to migrate Drafts 4 data to Drafts 5.

#### Important Notes:

- Migration requires Drafts 4.8.5 or greater be installed on the device doing the migration.
- Migration only once on a single device or duplicate data will be created. Once migrated, drafts and actions will sync to other devices.

### Migrating Drafts

To migrate drafts, visit `Settings > Migrate from Drafts 4 > Migrate Drafts`. If Drafts 4 is installed, Drafts 5 will see Drafts 4 data and migration will be available. A preview of the number of drafts to import will appear. Optionally, a tag can be assigned to drafts as they are migrated.  When ready, tap the "Migrate Now" button.  

Migration is typically quite fast, but may take a short time to complete if you have a large history of drafts. It is recommended you allow migration to complete before exiting Drafts. Immediately after migration, Drafts will begin syncing data to iCloud. This may take some time as well on a large import, so be patient waiting for new drafts to appear on other devices.

### Migrating Actions and Keys

Drafts 5 can migrate most actions and keyboard keys from Drafts 4. A few things to know:

- Drafts 4 had a single extended keyboard row which was configured separately from actions. In Drafts 5, the extended keyboard is built from action groups. Because of this, migration of the custom keyboard row will create a new action group with the migrated keys.
- Drafts 5 support many new, more powerful actions - but not all actions available in Drafts 4 can be supported in Drafts 5. Mostly notably, Drafts 5 does not currently support Evernote integration, but there are other items that do not directly translate. Migration will make note of the number of actions which could not be migrated. In these cases, check the Action Directory for similar replacements, or contact support for assistance.
